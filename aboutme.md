I once memorised the 30 first digits of $\pi$.   
I have been trying to forget them ever since!

I'm absolutely passionate about maths, music, languages and art.  

My favorite number is $i^i$, because it looks totally imaginary, but it's not: it's actually 0.207. (Or $\exp\left({-\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)$, to be precise).

Next on my list of favorites is the number 37: It's the 12th prime number, while 73 is the 21st. Awesome, isn't it?
