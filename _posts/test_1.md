# How to make your own website

Making a website is super easy! As long as you have the right tools. The tool I used to build this site is called **Jekyll**

### Why Jekyll?

I'll be brutally honest here: Simply because it's easy!  
It doesn't require installing packages, configuring virtual environments,... it's pretty much ready to use!  
All you need to do is follow the yellow brick road:

### Step 1: Have a GitHub account

You need a GitHub account.
GitHub allows you to host a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).
This means you can have your own website in GitHub.  
But it's static, so it cannot have any applications the user interacts with.
Still, that's a very small price to pay for such an easy way to make a website.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one [here] (https://github.com/).  
I won't go on the details on how to set up a GitHub account here, but if you need help doing that, you can probably find it in this [tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Step 2: For the Beautifull Jekyll repository

One you have your GitHub account set up, look for a repository called [Beautifull Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). Actually, you don't need to look for it. Just click on the link and you'll get there :)
